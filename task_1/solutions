## Suitable Solutions for Team Snake Web App

### Security

Place the load balancer in a DMZ behind a firewall for secure external access. 
The load balancer (e.g. HA Proxy) can also have reverse proxy (NGINX) to handle incoming traffic.
TLS termination at the load balancer. Use isolated, private subnets for the payment processor integration service, database and redis cache. 
Restrict internal communication via security groups or similar features.

### High Availabilty / Reliability / Scalability

Host the DB and Redis cache in multi-AZ clusters with failover mechanism. 
Web servers, API servers and app servers can be deployed in auto scaling groups (for on-prem use VM orchestration, or use AGS in AWS).

### Performance

Use Redis cache and keep Web and API services stateless so new instances can be quickly and automatically provisioned. Optionally use a CDN and offload static files to CDN for global distribution of content.

### Observability

LEverage Prometheus to collect metrics from all servers, services and databases. 
Visualise metrics on Grafana.
Centralise logging with ELK Stack.
